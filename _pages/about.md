I'm a Computer Science graduate student at UMass Amherst, pursuing my M.S. as a Bay State Fellow while conducting research at the Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval (CIIR). My work focuses on asymmetric personalization in language models and recommendation systems, with recent projects exploring how to tailor AI-generated content to individual users across diverse domains. I'm passionate about applying machine learning to real-world problems—from improving geospatial models on iNaturalist to building scalable AI services—and I'm committed to leveraging data science for meaningful impact.
