## Work Experience

### Student Researcher
**Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval – UMass Amherst**  
*April 2025 – Present* | Amherst, MA

- Conducting research on personalization for cold-start settings in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, leveraging Stack Exchange data to model user behavior and develop cross-domain profiling techniques
- Performed comprehensive experimental analysis to evaluate personalization models, deriving new research questions and insights
- Presented findings at the CIIR Poster Series

### Student Researcher
**Initiative for Digital Public Infrastructure – UMass Amherst**  
*February 2025 – September 2025* | Amherst, MA

- Investigated topic distributions on YouTube by applying clustering algorithms to large-scale video embedding datasets (~16,000 samples)
- Analyzed how embedding representations influence topic granularity and revealed structural patterns within the platform's content ecosystem
- Developed a multilingual recommendation analysis pipeline using the YouTube Innertube API, generating recommendation trees to study cross-language exposure paths and user discovery patterns across linguistic boundaries

### Researcher
**Center for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence – UMass Amherst**  
*May 2024 – May 2025* | Amherst, MA

- Built a machine learning pipeline for song recommendation using learning-to-rank models (XGBoost, scikit-learn) for the music therapy app SingFit, contributing to an academic publication
- Designed and implemented a versatile text classification suite for large language models using LangChain, enabling rapid experimentation across multiple NLP tasks
- Developed and deployed full-stack web annotation platforms for the NSF Buzzards Bay water preservation project and iNaturalist, leveraging React, PostgreSQL, and Azure cloud services
- Fine-tuned geo-predictive models with PyTorch, utilizing user-generated labels from iNaturalist, improving species location inference accuracy

### Course Teaching Assistant
**College of Information and Computer Sciences – UMass Amherst**  
*September 2022 – Present* | Amherst, MA

- **CS446: Search Engines** – Introduced and taught a new module on Retrieval-Augmented Generation, designed and implemented programming assignments, developed automated grading tools
- **CS121, CS230, CS326** – Provided academic support to hundreds of students through office hours, project guidance, and grading assistance
- Received the **Outstanding UCA Award** for excellence in teaching, communication, and collaboration across multiple semesters
