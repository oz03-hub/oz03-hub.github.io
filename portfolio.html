      <p>
        I am Ozel Yilmazel, a senior year Computer Science undergraduate at
        UMass Amherst. I have a deep passion for machine learning and natural
        language processing. Currently, I am interning at Center for Data
        Science at UMass, where I contribute to the research paper
        <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02564">SINR</a> by improving
        GeoModels on iNaturalist through the development of a web-based
        annotation tool called iNatAtor. I took the lead on fine tuning
        GeoModels with annotation data. In addition, I developed a data
        extractor which transformed saved annotations on iNatAtor into data
        usable for fine tuning GeoModels. I also took part in developing the
        front-end of the application, integrated a Postgres database to manage
        annotations, and containerized the application to assist in deployment.
        This project has advanced the development of open-source projects,
        iNaturalist and SINR. Additionally, I have a strong interest in web
        development and am continuously learning new frameworks to expand my
        skill set.

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <h3>CatGAN</h3>
      CatGAN is a modified CycleGAN model developed in pytorch. CatGAN achieves
      domain translation of images, Humans to Cat. The translations are learned
      through features extracted from convolutions, therefore each human has a
      unique cat transformation, and every cat has a unique human translation.
      CycleGAN paper originally recognizes the limitations of geometric
      transformations, this project shows it is possible.
      <ul>
        <li>
          Implemented my own
          <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10593">CycleGAN</a> model to train
          unpaired image transformations from Humans to Cats and back to Humans.
        </li>
        <li>
          Contributed to the research by showing geometric transformations are
          achievable by modifying model architecture and prioritizing a loss
          objective.

      <h3>Twitter Bot Classification</h3>
      This project is a research report that focuses on classifying human and
      bot accounts on Twitter, using only textual data (username and tweet). In
      this report we explore a variety of approaches to semantic analysis:
      shallow models, transformer ensembles, and few-shot learning with LLMs.
      Each approach gets more complex than the previous one and achieves higher
      scores. Our results using transformer ensembles put us among the best
      results discussed in the TwiBot-20 paper. Our report provides semantic
      analysis that is competitive to other bot classification techniques that
      use the full metadata of accounts. We believe that when our approaches are
      combined with ambitious metadata classifiers it could achieve higher
      classification scores.
      <ul>
        <li>
          Engineered semantic analysis solutions using shallow models: Naive
          Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fine tuned BERT and Twi-BERT to classify tweet data and trained a
          random tree model to classify based on username and tweet data, all
          three models were combined to create an ensemble logistic regression
          model.

      StackBuildIO is an AI powered tech-stack builder/generator for those who
      are not familiar with what to use on their projects. You can enter a
      prompt to describe your project and it will refer you to a tech-stack. You
      can save and share your tech-stack with other users on the platform, and
      can make edits any time you want.
